<p>To enter experimental information, there are several optional groupings which will assist in analysis.</p>
<p>Measurements which occur together are grouped into experiments, which are then grouped together as a Study</p>
<p>When animals are treated with something, they are grouped into Treatment groups (see <a href="{% url 'treatment-list' %}">here</a>.  A particular treatment (such as High Fat Diet) may be performed on several different groups of animals.  Several treatments together, done at the same time are called Cohorts (see <a href="{% url 'cohort-list' %}">here</a>).  Therefore a study may consist of several cohorts, which themselves may consist of several treatment groups.</p>
